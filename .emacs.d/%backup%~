Learning computer science in school and personal projects I lack the perspective of how this all applys to the real world. Internship in a location outside of New Jersey, a new state where I can live and work on improving my knowledge in the workforce is a huge motivator.

My most comfortable language is Java.  I would say my best skills so far is version control, publishing, emacs, and using command line tools.  I use Linux via wsl2 on windows and have learned a lot about the Linux ecosystem which is my favorite topic right now.

I was apart of Hackdown 2021 at TCNJ where my team made a graphical display of A* shortest path using Java.  In addition I have made a Java game where I learned about managing a medium sized code base and using build tools and using gwt maven, and git to publish my project.
